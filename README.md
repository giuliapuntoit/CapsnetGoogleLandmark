# Capsnet Google Landmark

Small work to perform a comparison between CapsNet and traditional Convolutional Neural Networks on the Google Landmark Recognition Challenge.

## Motivation

This project was developed for the AIML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) course in Politecnico di Torino in the academic year 2019/2020. 

## Description

* Code of Capsnet for the Google Landmark Recognition Challenge is in [capsnet](https://github.com/giuliapuntoit/CapsnetGoogleLandmark/blob/main/project_CapsNet.ipynb);
* Code of CNNs for the Google Landmark Recognition Challenge is in [cnn](https://github.com/giuliapuntoit/CapsnetGoogleLandmark/blob/main/project_VGG16.ipynb).

A detailed description of this project can be found in [comparison](https://github.com/giuliapuntoit/CapsnetGoogleLandmark/blob/main/AIML_projectfinal.pdf).
